## <CEAD,P>=X
It represents our vision that when novel techniques within Computational Engineering Analysis and Design (CEAD) are applied to problems (P), they have the potential to transform the problem and give us the desired innovative solution (X). 

This organization and space will share the ongoing work in developing new analysis and design algorithms and computational methods to solve key engineering problems. Our lab/group aims to integrate traditional computational methods with machine learning and neural networks and propose algorithms to extend our problem-solving capabilities.
